# Vulkan Tutorial
A repository dedicated to me learning Rust while simultaneously learning Vulkan
by using the Vulkanalia Rust package.

### Navigation
Every branch corresponds to a different chapter in the Vulkan Tutorial for Rust;
therefore, if you are interested in a specific concept, use the branch list to
select the branch with the relevant name and/or chapter number.

### Branch naming scheme
<##>-\<chapter-name>

### Note
This is not my own implementation - besides that which I had to add or change
because of problems not addressed in the tutorial I followed; therefore, please
refer to the "Vulkan Tutorial (Rust)" at this link: https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia/introduction.html
